        <p>Hi there, welcome to my website :)</p>
        <p> I graduated in Dec 2018 with a B.S. in computer science from UC San Diego. While I was in school, I had the opportunity to explore a range of topics, from artificial intelligence and software development all the way down to networking and hardware. Check out a project I did in data mining 
        <a href="resources/Predictive_Approach_to_Card_Loyalty.pdf">here</a> 
        and distributed systems 
        <a href="resources/Factory_Monitoring_for_the_21st_Century.pdf">here</a>!
        I also got to work on a project team
        (<a href="https://globalties.ucsd.edu/projects/town-country-learning.html">TCLC</a>) 
        dedicated to social innovation, and spend a summer working for Mitre in Boston, where I contributed to 
        <a href="https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki">Synthea</a>,
        a project designed to influence public health policy. Synthea and TCLC are just some of the ways that technology can benefit society, and as technology improves, I'm excited to add to my skillset and grow along with it.
